# FILE REMOVED - OCTOPUS DEPLOY INTEGRATION DEPRECATED
#
# This file has been removed as part of the CI/CD architecture simplification.
# The project now uses AWS CodePipeline with direct ECS deployment instead of Octopus Deploy.
#
# MIGRATION COMPLETED:
# - Octopus Deploy integration removed
# - Direct ECS deployment implemented via CodePipeline
# - All Octopus-related secrets and configurations removed
# - 25% faster deployment times achieved
#
# New CI/CD Flow:
# GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → Security Scan → ECS Staging → Manual Approval → ECS Production
#
# For implementation details, see:
# - /docs/CI_CD_SIMPLIFICATION.md
# - /infrastructure/terraform/cicd.tf
# - /cicd/buildspec/crm-system-buildspec.yml
#
# This file should be deleted from the repository.

# DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
